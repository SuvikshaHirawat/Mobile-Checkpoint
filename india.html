        <p>These are a few snippets from back home that I find alluring
            I think these are sights that may puzzle/amuse those who don’t come from India and so I’d like to share!</p>
    
        <div class="card">            <img src = "images/h_cows.jpg" alt="cows being fed by a lady on the street" width="500"/>
            <p> This sight is not a rare one. Cows roam the streets and tend to sit down and rest wherever they deem fit. It is upto whoever else that may use that road to figure the rest out.
            Here, a woman feeds the cow while a car awaits- trying to figure out the obstacle course.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_door.jpg" alt="carpet in front of the door" width="500"/>
            <P>In the picture is a handwoven carpet that my grandma made by upcycling her old saris (a traditional garment of 7 yards draped around the body). Also at the door’s entrance  are flowers kept on either side and more of the rangoli. This time in simple 6 lines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_flowerajji.jpg" alt="flowers on an old lady's braid" width="500"/>
            <p>It is custom for women to wear jasmine in their hair as it is one of the signs of being married. The rose was an offering to god which she placed in her briad after the daily prayers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_fruits.jpg" alt="lady buying fruit from a street cart" width="500"/>
            <p>I find it endearing and feel lucky to know that I have access to fresh produce within a 2 min walk from my home.-and on the days I'm lazy, the produce comes to me!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_ganesha.jpg" alt="kids celebrating on a parade truck" width="500"/>
            <p>The neighbourhood kids on a parade. At the end of the festival ‘Ganesha’, there is a ‘block party’ of sorts with a stage and a band performing while food flows through the crowds. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_holi.jpg" alt="men celebrating the Indian festival of colours" width="500"/>
            <p> Quite a puzzling scene isn't it? Men doused in pink powder waiting around? Err….
            Well, these men have just happened to play Holi- the "Festival of Colours" that celebrates the triumph of good over evil.
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_rangoli.jpg" alt="two women making street art" width="500"/>
            <p>Here you can see two women having washed the front of their house with water and putting ‘rangoli’ (R-uh-ng-oh-l-ih).
            It is a geometric pattern that represents the happiness, positivity and liveliness of a household, intending to welcome
            the goddess of wealth and good luck.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_scooty.jpg" alt="man on a scooter carrying goods" width="500"/>
            <p>It's funny because people will go to lengths to avoid getting an actual truck when it comes to transporting goods. Here, a man sits uncomfortably, barely reaching the handles, accommodating a truck's worth of goods onto a two-wheeler.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <img src = "images/h_vehicle.jpg" alt="cars with flower garlands on windshields" width="500"/>
            <p>In- yes you guessed it-yet another festival- the ‘peculiar’ tradition is to worship objects with engines. Why you ask? I don't really know. Will have to call my grandma to find out.</p>
