        <p>Hi im suviksha:) I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan on the UX Research and Design track. I grew up in India in the pleasant easy climate of Bangalore. I studied architecture for 5 years and love the nostalgic recounts of 80’s interiors and design. I've played a sport all my life- football at first and now ultimate frisbee. My idea of fun is to ORGANIZATION- and volunteer my services to anyone who may need it. There is nothing more I like than the sun streaming in through a large window and that concludes this paragraph of random facts about me.</p>

        <img src = "images/pictureofme.jpg" alt="Headshot of Suviksha Hirawat" width="200" class="headshot"/>
        <p>Here is a photograph of what I look like and this is the same one I use on my whatsapp, Linkedin, zoom, you name it. When you find the one- you find the one.</p>
        </div>

      
    <div class="homegriditem">
        <p>Onto why you're here- this is my photography blog.
            I have two sections as of now: An ‘edits’ section that displays my experimentations with the app Lightroom and ‘ Frome Home’ is a repository of sweet memories from a well-back home.
            I hope the edits make you feel uneasy and the photos from home make you feel warm.
            Hurry along now- take a look-<p>
